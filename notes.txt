Pure CSS side-note: How do they do the thing where I can create, say,
a 3-column layout of equally width columns that stays that way
regardless of the overall width? For example, the pricing layout:

http://purecss.io/layouts/pricing/

has max-width: 980px on the pricing row (with 3 columns). The
resulting width could be anything (in a range from whatever width it
becomes columnar at, to 980). How do they set each column to a third
of that? Wouldn't they have to set width: XXXpx and adjust it with
JavaScript (which is clearly not going on)? I want to see how this
feat is accomplished.
